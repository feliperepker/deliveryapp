# Delivery app

This project was made to a productive area in a company.
The goal was to call the operator when he could grab a item, and give it a timer to that.



### Difficulties

I had a difficulty with date, It was not easy to treat dates and to compare one to each other.
It was my second project using React, so I had some problems with States and how they work.

### Finally

I had fun doing this project. It was a very usefull application and teach me a lot. And have a lot of potential too.

#### Created with React and .NET 6.0
